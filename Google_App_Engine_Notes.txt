App Engine
	
	Google Apple Engine is a PaaS service which is used to deploy the services into the Google Cloud.
	
	Features
		Automatic Load Balancing, Auto Scaling
		Since its PaaS offering, the platform updates and health monitoring is taken care by Google
		Supports multiple versions
		Traffic Splitting
		
	Environments
		
		Standard
			Application runs within the lanugage specific sandboxes. There are two versions,
			v1: Supports old versions of Java, PHP, Python, Go, etc.
			v2: Supports newer versions of Java, PHP, Python, Go, etc.
		
		Flexible
			Application runs within the Docker containers. App Engine Flexible makes use of the Compute Engine Virtual Machines. Supports ANY runtime, since the application runs within the Docker containers. Provides access to the local disks and background processes.
			
	App Engine - Application Hierarchy
	
		Each project can have only one application, each application can have many services (microservices) and each service can have many versions. Each version can run in one or more instances. We can rollback a particular version or split traffic between different versions. Multiple versions can co-exist.
		
	App Engine Standard vs App Engine Flexible
	
									Standard				Flexible
			
		Pricing			  Instance Hours					Based on no of vCPUS, Memory, Disk, etc.
		Scaling			  Manual, Basic, Automatic			Manual, Automatic
		Scaling to Zero	  Yes								No
		Instance startup  in seconds						in Mins
		Rapid scaling	  Yes								No
		Max req timeout	  1 to 10 mins						60 mins
		SSH for debugging No								Yes
		
	Auto Scale Options
		Automatic
			Automatically scale instances based on the load. Recommended for continuously running workloads. Auto scale based on,
				Target CPU Utilization
				Target Throughput Utilization
				Max concurrent requests
			Configure Max and Min instances
		Basic
			Instances are created as and when requests are received. Recommended for Adhoc workoads. Instances are shutdown if ZERO requests. Configure Max instances and Idle timeout.
		Manual
			Adjust the configuration manually.
	
	When we deploy an app to the App engine, the source code will be uploaded to Googld Cloud storage and a deployment package will be created by the Google cloud run by accessing the google cloud storage, then the deployment package will be deployed to the app engine.
	
	Deploy an app
		glcoud app deploy
		gcloud app deploy --version=<<version>> (Note: If we don't give version, it will be set automatically)
		gcloud app deploy --image-url=<<image_url>> (Note: the image should present within any of the gcr repositories)
		gcloud app deploy --no-promote (Note: Dont set the app to serve any requests)
		
	Listing available services/versions
		glcoud app services list
		gcloud app versions list
		gcloud app instances list
	
	Get details of a particular service/version (like url of the service, etc)
		gcloud app browse
		gcloud app browse --version=<<version>> --service=<<service_id>>
	
	Split the traffic between different versions
		gcloud app services split-traffic --splits=<<split_by_version>>	(Note: eg: --splits=v1=0.5,v2=0.5)
		gcloud app services split-traffic --splits=<<split_by_version>> --split-by=<<split_by_option>>	(Note: available split by options: random, cookie, ip (ip is the default one)).
